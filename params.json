With Pyknon you can generate Midi files quickly and reason about musical proprieties. It works with Python 2.7 and 3.2.\r\n\r\nIt's a library intended for teaching and demonstrating, so you should have no problems reading the source code. On the other hand, it doesn't do a lot of checking, so it's easy to break (and if you break it, you buy it). If you find bugs, please report at our [issue tracking system](https://github.com/kroger/pyknon/issues).\r\n\r\nYou can install Pyknon using pip:\r\n\r\n    pip install pyknon\r\n\r\nPyknon is very simple to use, here's a basic example to create 4 notes and save into a MIDI file::\r\n\r\n    from pyknon.genmidi import Midi\r\n    from pyknon.music import NoteSeq\r\n\r\n    notes1 = NoteSeq(\"D4 F#8 A Bb4\")\r\n    midi = Midi(1, tempo=90)\r\n    midi.seq_notes(notes1, track=0)\r\n    midi.write(\"demo.mid\")\r\n\r\nAnd because we write Python code, we can generate more complex things\r\neasily. In the next example we convert the first 30 rows in\r\n[Pascal's triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle) to\r\nnotes:\r\n\r\n    from __future__ import division\r\n    from itertools import chain\r\n    from pyknon.genmidi import Midi\r\n    from pyknon.music import Note, NoteSeq\r\n\r\n    def pascals_triangle(n):\r\n        x = [1]\r\n        yield x\r\n        for i in range(n - 1):\r\n            x = [sum(i) for i in zip([0] + x, x + [0])]\r\n            yield x\r\n\r\n    seq = chain.from_iterable(pascals_triangle(30))\r\n    midi = Midi(tempo=120)\r\n    midi.seq_notes(NoteSeq([Note(x%12, 4, 1/16) for x in seq]))\r\n    midi.write(\"pascal.mid\")\r\n    \r\nYou can listen to the result [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/musicforgeeksandnerds.com/pascal.mp3).\r\n\r\nIn case you are wondering, Pyknon is a term from ancient Greek music theory: \"Intervallically dense region of non-diatonic, i.e., chromatic or enharmonic, genera.\" (http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/pyknon.aspx)\r\n\r\nIf you like this, you may be interested in my book, [Music for Geeks and Nerds](http://musicforgeeksandnerds.com)"}
