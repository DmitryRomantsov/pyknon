Pyknon Documentation
======================

Pyknon is a simple library for music Set Theory. The main goal is to
have a simple library to write short scripts. For instance, if you
want to write an on-line tool to generate 12-tone rows, this library
maybe to you. On the other hand, if you want to parse music in complex
formats such as MIDI or MusicXML and perform complex operations
involving pitch and rhythm, you should use something like
`music21 <http://mit.edu/music21/>`_.

Another goal of Pyknon is to be something good to reason about the
properties and operations of pitch-class sets.
